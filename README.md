# ESE_124_Final_Project
Final project code for ESE 124

This branch contains the main file, a function that takes in the input file (expected to be a maze) and guides Micheal to traverse the maze using functions from the stack file.


The main function then will execute the apporpriate functions from stack, such as pop and peek, to help Micheal go through the maze.
