Final project code for ESE 124.

Micheal is an ant, and his memory is represented as a stack. We will use a maze to allow Micheal to move around using x and y coordinates according to user input and collect "good deeds".

This branch contains the main file, a function that takes in the input file (expected to be a maze) and guides Micheal to traverse the maze using functions from the stack file.


The main function then will execute the apporpriate functions from stack, such as pop and peek, to help Micheal go through the maze.

Micheal will constantly read the value of where it is in the maze, and if it is on a good deed ( represented as a number in the input file ), then this is recognized in the code.
